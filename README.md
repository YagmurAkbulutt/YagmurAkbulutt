- 👋 Hi, I’m @YagmurAkbulutt I am a clinical psychologist and front-end developer candidate. I work as a clinical psychologist because of my interest in the human mind, and I have stepped into the software world to develop my interest in computer technology.
- 👀 My career goal I aim to combine the knowledge and experience I gained as a clinical psychologist with projects in the software world. By working at the intersection of psychology and software, I aim to develop innovative projects where I can use technology in the field of human psychology and mental health.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning basic technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while also trying to gain experience using modern libraries.
- 💞️ As someone who is patient, has strong communication skills and manages time well, I must state that I am open to all kinds of feedback and cooperation. I can't wait to develop better projects with your feedback!
